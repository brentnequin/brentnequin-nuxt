I am a recent graduate from the University of Illinois at Chicago with a Master's degree in Electrical Engineering. I love to write software and play guitar. You can read more about me on my [about](http://brentnequin.com/about/) page.

Sometimes I enjoy writing posts about some of the things I am interested in on my [blog](http://brentnequin.com/blog).

Sometimes I spend my time working on [projects](http://brentnequin.com/projects/) to sharpen my programming skills.

I am currently based in Chicago, IL working for [Epsilon](https://www.epsilon.com/us).
